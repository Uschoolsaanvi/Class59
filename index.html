    <p id="para" onmouseover="changecolor()">My hobby is drawing. Drawing is my favorite hobby. When I get some free time after my studies,I go to my room to draw and paint. Drawing is an activity which requires patience. The coloring between the lines,
    painting within the canvas and stress bearing during art competitions make my mind fresh. After school, I will get a paper and pencil so that I can practice my drawing skills.</p>
